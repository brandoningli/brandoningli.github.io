### Coursework
[truman-coursework-samples](https://mrbmi513.github.io/truman-coursework-samples) contains some code samples from various courses I've taken in the Truman CS department.  
I do not promote nor condone the misuse of this code for academic dishonesty, nor do I assume any responsibility for consequences resulting from such misuse.

### Independent Projects
Here's a bit (okay, more like millions of bits) of what I like to do in my spare time.
+ [groupme-chat-tools](https://github.com/mrbmi513/groupme-chat-tools) - A collection of Python scripts interfacing with the GroupMe API. There's even a couple that experiment with Python's Tkinter graphics library.
+ [its-point-tracker](https://mrbmi513.github.io/its-point-tracker) - A system based on Google Apps to keep track of an analyze International Thespian Society points. It should be (somewhat) easily modified to handle other types of point tracking data. This version is a simplified and slightly refactored version of the fully-featured version used by my ITS troupe to this day.
+ [truman-laundry-monitor](https://github.com/mrbmi513/truman-laundry-monitor) - A project that was never actually tested nor implemented, but designed to provide students with a dashboard for the dormitory laundry room, including alerts for the end of a cycle. Sadly, Truman contracts their laundry maintenance to a third-party that wouldn't appreciate sensors being stuck to their machines, so there's a low probability of this ever going forward.
+ [Truman Textbook Search](https://mrbmi513.github.io/booksearch) - A simple tool for Truman students to help compare textbook prices.
+ [Tuner](https://mrbmi513.github.io/tuner) - A JS based Tuner / Tone generator.
+ [slack-web-integrations](https://mrbmi513.github.io/slack-web-integrations/) - A very basic tutorial for a family friend into very basic web integrations in [Slack](https://slack.com/). There's even a very poor example of one I wrote to accompany a food-ordering webapp I made very early on for my family's internal use.

### A Look Back
A sampling of things I did in High School and earlier. Ah, the nostalgia!
+ [Webster-U-HS-Programming-Challenge](https://github.com/mrbmi513/Webster-U-HS-Programming-Challenge) - Practice leading up to my participation in Webster University's (St. Louis) High School Programming Challenge. My team, "Fuzzy Logic", took home 9th place of over 20 teams. Please note that some of these responses went untested as I was frantically preparing in the days leading to the competition.
+ [CPlusPlus-Final-Project](https://github.com/mrbmi513/CPlusPlus-Final-Project) - The result of my final project in the C++ course I took my Senior year of high school: learn something new. I taught a friend some **Python**. So there's no actual C++ here. Sorry for the confusion.
